  { id: 1, raceId: 1, name: 'Circle of Nations', description: 'Led by the Terran monarch, the Circle of Nations was the product of several wars of unification in the early years of humanityâ€™s colonial era. The Circle prides itself on order, efficiency, and an unwavering dedication to the Crown. The primary national influences of the Circle are Russia and Britain. The Circle is a benevolent but conservative dictatorship in which the people have an extremely high level of satisfaction, so long as they live within the tight and unforgiving confines of the law. The capital city of the Circle is London, Earth.' },
  { id: 2, raceId: 1, name: 'Thurelian Republic', description: 'The Republic was formed when the Circle became reckless with power, and the Japanese and Australian powers seceded from the Terran empire. In stark contrast to the Circle, citizens of the Republic value freedom and liberty, with a distaste for government control. The Republic is a libertarian democracy in which the government has little say in how the people run their lives. However, the total free market has spawned many monopolies, driving up the cost of living. This, combined with governmental corruption and poor funding for public services causes many citizens to be dissatisfied. The capital city of the Republic is Thurelia, City of Thureas, a goliath space colony.' },
  { id: 3, raceId: 1, name: 'Non-Aligned Worlds', description: 'To the side, and away from the main conflict lies a smattering of planets that either have chosen to remain independent, or are too small for either large conglomerate to care much about. Chief among these worlds are three large kingdoms, Vaihaven, Corhaven, and Valdhaven, each with a singular monarch. These worlds are generally quiet, preferring to stay out of the heat of interstellar politics.' },
